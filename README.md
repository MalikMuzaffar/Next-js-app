This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

1.	Created/Cloned and tested a Next.js application on a virtual machine to validate runtime and accessibility via VM IP. 
2.	Dockerized the application by writing a custom Dockerfile, building images, and running containers locally. 
3.	Initialized a Git repository and pushed the full application code to GitHub for version control and collaboration. 
4.	Built a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate Docker image builds, tag images with build numbers, and push to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). 
5.	Deployed the application on AWS App Runner, leveraging ECR as the container source for a fully managed containerized deployment. 
6.	Implemented IAM roles and security best practices for safe integration between GitHub, ECR, and App Runner. 


## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
