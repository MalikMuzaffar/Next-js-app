This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
`
Notes For Myself: 
1.  Clone this Next.js application on a virtual machine, validate runtime and accessibility via VM IP. 
2.	Dockerized the application by writing a custom Dockerfile, building images, and running containers locally. 
3.	Initialized a Git repository and pushed the full application code to GitHub for version control and collaboration. 
4.	Built a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate Docker image builds, tag images with build numbers, and push to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). 
5.	Deployed the application on AWS App Runner, leveraging ECR as the container source for a fully managed containerized deployment. 
6.	Implemented IAM roles and security best practices for safe integration between GitHub, ECR, and App Runner.
